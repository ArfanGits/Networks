🟦 Room 1: Introduction to Cyber Security

What I learned:
What cybersecurity means
Difference between defensive & offensive roles
Importance of confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA)
Why attackers target systems
Basic analyst vocabulary

Why this matters:
SOC analysts must speak the language → logs, alerts, threats, events, IoCs.

🟦 Room 2: Linux Fundamentals Part 1

Commands practiced:
Command	Meaning
ls	list files
cd	change directory
pwd	show path
cat	read files
grep	search text
chmod	change permissions
chown	change ownership

Why this matters:
Linux is 60% of cybersecurity — servers, tools, shells, logs, malware analysis.

🟦 Room 3: Network Fundamentals

Topics:
Ports (22, 80, 443, 445, 3389, etc.)
IP addressing (public vs private)
Packets
TCP vs UDP
OSI model basics

Why this matters:
Understanding packets + protocols = SOC detection power.
