1. IP Address

A device’s network “home address.”

Types
* Public IP:** Assigned by ISP, visible online.
* Private IP:** Used inside home/office networks.

**Why It Matters (Cyber)**

Used to identify attackers, internal vs external traffic, brute-force attempts.

2. MAC Address

A device’s permanent hardware identifier (like a fingerprint).

Cyber Use
Tracks specific devices, detects spoofing, traces lateral movement.

---

3. DNS (Domain Name System)
  
The internet’s “phonebook” that converts website names → IPs.
Example: `google.com → 142.x.x.x`

Cyber Use
Detects phishing domains, DNS tunneling, suspicious lookups.

---

4. DHCP
  
Automatically gives devices an IP address and network settings.

Cyber Use
Shows when new/unknown devices join the network. Rogue DHCP = attack vector.
